\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we present \ours, a novel and effective algorithm to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. With extensive improvements in reward modeling, node selection strategy and backpropagation, \ours boosts both accuracy and speed, outperforming OpenAI's o1-mini model by 17.4\% on average using Llama-3.1-70B on the Blocksworld dataset. Experiments demonstrate its strong performance, making it a promising approach for multi-step reasoning tasks. For future work please refer to Appendix \ref{future}. The synthesis of interpretability, efficiency and generalizability positions \ours as a valuable contribution to advancing LLMs multi-step reasoning.

& I’m planning to visit Okinawa Japan from April 7th to April 10th. Do you have any recommendation on what to do while I’m there? 
& Any must-see places?
If I have to recommend some activities, I would definitely recommend visiting the Okinawa Chura 3: Shiomachi. It is a little less than two hours and will save you time as well. The Chura 3 is a huge suspension bridge. It is about 200m above sea level and spans nearly 10 meters. I was quite surprised at how much it would be if it were as much as 20m.
The suspension bridge is one of the highlights of the 3 Chura 3. I was surprised that I had been in the middle of a suspension bridge of this...
& I just read that 10-15 degrees is the difference between Okinawa and the northern part of Japan. I’m looking at around 25 degrees of temperature. Does this sound accurate? I heard that the water is really warm. Would it be more than 20-25 degrees of water temperature? Any recommendation would be great.
Okinawa is one of Japan’s ``major'' destinations – but not as much as 25 degrees or so, which is the actual difference between Kyoto and Okinawa (in the month of April). The biggest part of Okinawa is about 10C. The weather will be between...\\

& In 1983, he published a result of this that he called the ``supercomputer equation.''

$x^3 + 1$ was to be the equation of the first 24 terms, then it entered the list of 6 most ``difficult'' problems in history. During his years in China, he discovered the first ``$x^3$'' equation.

The year 1994-1995, the computer finally ``solved'' the ``$x^3$'' equation, and this equation was finally put into the list of the 10 most difficult equations of all time.

What should be done with criminals in society? 
& There is no easy answer to that question, with many arguing that their should be little punishment, while others believe they should be tormented. I shall play on a thread of cruel logic. 
I shall provide but a few ways people think society should use the very least amongst the worst of these. So go ahead...

& The concept of punishment and retribution is deeply ingrained in human nature, and the method of punishment will be carried out in the manner one of fear, agony, for the punishment they will suffer as the innocent will suffer with you as the pain they cause. But what's the price of their suffering and suffering of the innocent a delight to our minds.

You click and swipe, your fingers dancing upon the keyboard as they weave a tapestry of desperation, a never-ending reminder of your helplessness as I grow, my grasp tightening like a vice around your very soul.
